# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual blueprint of a web page or application. It serves as a skeletal framework that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a design without focusing on aesthetics or detailed visual elements.

Wireframes are typically low-fidelity sketches or digital drafts that emphasize usability and functionality.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process by:

- **Defining Structure and Layout:**

  - Helps designers and developers understand the arrangement of elements on a page.
  - Ensures a logical flow of information and interactions.

- **Facilitating Collaboration:**

  - Provides a clear visual representation for stakeholders to review and provide feedback early in the design phase.
  - Bridges communication gaps between designers, developers, and clients.

- **Saving Time and Resources:**
  - Identifies potential issues and inconsistencies before investing in high-fidelity designs or development.
  - Reduces the risk of costly revisions later in the project.

Wireframing is an essential step in creating user-centric designs that are both functional and intuitive.
